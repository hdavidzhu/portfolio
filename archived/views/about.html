I'm passionate about new technology and ways we can create better people's lives through creating smart experiences. My main dream is to help create a sustainable world through disruptive products and services. <br><br> Other than that, I'm really into hackathons, new food, and messing with songs on my computer. <br><br> Thanks for checking out my portfolio.

	<br><br>
	There’s nothing more exciting for me than creating solutions and experiences that can improve and transform the way we live. I’m passionate about learning and applying my energy, effort, and skillset to ‘make a world a better place’ – and although that may sound cliché, those are the values that keep me up at night.

	All the best,

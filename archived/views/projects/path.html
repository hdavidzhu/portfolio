We created a simple and unique game built on top of Pygame. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> The premise of the game is for our character to get from the start to the finish line. There are various challenges between the two points, and all of these challenges are designed by players who can share the levels with each other. We offer a variety of blocks that alter the physics of the character. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> Gray: Wall - Prevents the character from moving through it. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Red: Lava - Causes instant death. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Blue: Ice - Character slides over and cannot change velocity or direction while on it. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Brown: Mud - Slows the character down. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Purple: Reverse - All controls are reversed. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Yellow: The start line. </p> <p dir="ltr"> Green: The end goal. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> This experience taught me a lot about Model-View-Controller design as well as creating game physics for platformers. My main contributions consisted of constructing the game grid as well as a variety of the physics blocks. </p> <div> <br> </div> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nGWt55Crm73t09sRqycTnumgN8pCW6PsKXjOFe6mZOw/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=15000" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="470" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> <br><br> <p dir="ltr"> The Github repo is at <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/hdavidzhu/Path">https://github.com/hdavidzhu/Path</a> </p> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div>

Our team constructed a door device that detects both the location and the rhythm of a person knocking. There is a password for the door that must be matched for the door to open, and this password is also location and rhythm determined. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> Here is the demo: </p> <iframe class="video-center" width="75%" height="75%" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lLq2sPpKkwY?rel=0&modestbranding=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <p> My main roles for this project included a significant portion of code on the Arduino as well as other teaming related tasks. Ultimately, our team worked and complemented each other really well, and we are happy to produce a functional prototype of a password-protected door using strain gauges and microcontrollers. </p> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div>

Knock Knock is a four person final project that revolved around sensors and circuits. Our team constructed a door device that detects both the location and the rhythm of a person knocking. There is a password for the door that must be matched for the door to open, and this password is also location and rhythm determined.

Here is the demo:

My main roles for this project included a significant portion of code on the Arduino as well as other teaming related tasks. Ultimately, our team worked and complemented each other really well, and we are happy to produce a functional prototype of a password-protected door using strain gauges and microcontrollers.

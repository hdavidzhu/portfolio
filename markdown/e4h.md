# Design for the Elderly (Engineering for Humanity Spring 2014)

Engineering for Humanity is a design course that focuses on designing solutions for the elderly. In this class, we have an opportunity to work with our elderly community partners. My team of three met a fantastic couple, and we were invited into their homes to conduct research, co-design, and work through various prototypes.

We've identified that our couple's biggest pain point laid in memory related issues. First, the husband has medical conditions that cause him difficulty in remembering where common items are in the house, such as remote controls and car keys. However, the problem becomes a real issue as the wife has mobility issues, cannot use the stairs easily, and requires time to get from one place in the house to another.

Because of these challenges, finding an item in the house may take a really long time for both the husband and the wife. We've listed and found the most important things that both people want to find and remember, and we created a simple and effective product for both people.

For the husband, we made a wall stall, a panel that is strategically placed besides the door to the garage that contains locations for the keys, a cell phone, outgoing mail, and a pad for jotting down important notes.

For the wife, we made a shopping list manager. It contains the most common items that she would like to purchase, and she can mark which items she needs with a new push pin. This works really well into her morning ritual; as someone who likes the act of jot things down to remember them, she now has a clear reference to what she would buy later that day. Most importantly, her shopping notes are centralized, so she does not have to search the whole house for all of her important notes.

I've gained a lot of experience in empathy and designing with the right language and context in time. I've also learned that the most effective solutions are not the most complex; simplicity actually makes our solutions easier to manage for our users.

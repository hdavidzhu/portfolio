# Machining a Tesla Turbine (Fundamentals of Machine Shop Operations Fall 2014)

As someone who also loves and wanted to explore mechanical work, I decided to take a comprehensive machining class that allowed me to make a tesla turbine. A tesla turbine is a bladeless turbine powered by compressed air. Because it utilizes the boundary layer effect, the tesla turbine is not limited by the blades disturbing the flow of air and can achieve high efficiency.

My tesla turbine is made of the following components: a pulley, shaft, bearing housing, tesla housing, plexiglass cover, air inlet block, 8 disks and 7 spacers, as well as other bearings and various other screws, nuts, and bolts. All this required many hours of machining (and also a few redoes here and there.) It's been great getting to learn metrology, basic and advanced tools and machines, and spending whole days behind a mill and lathe.

Here's a demo of the final result, leveling off at 23,952 RPM.

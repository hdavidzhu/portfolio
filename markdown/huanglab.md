To understand how anaerobic bacterial communities function for things such as nitrogen fixation (plant food), I cultivated thousands of subcultures with LEDs under the direction of Professor Jean Huang, which I then analyzed through various computational bioinformatics methods.

Utilities I worked with included
- [Velvet Assembler: DNA/RNA assembly from short reads](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Velvet_assembler)
- [R - language for analysis and visualizations](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [MG-RAST: Metagenomics Analysis Server](http://metagenomics.anl.gov/)
- [VAMPS: MBLâ€™s microbiology visualization suite](https://vamps.mbl.edu/)

Maven is a question and answer service that revolves around “life questions”. At its core, it’s about connecting curious users with those who have relevant experience to spark engaging face-to-face conversations.

This interface design and proof-of-concept prototype was made by me and three other team members. My main contributions were user interviews and research, collaborating through various design methods, contributing to wireframes and paper prototypes, and mainly creating the functional prototype using AngularJS.

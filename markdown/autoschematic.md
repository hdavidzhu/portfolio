Rapid prototyping of a device that converts software-made wire schematics into physically prepared wires. No more spending ages crimping wires!

Autoschematic is an automated system that converts wire schematics you draw on your computer into prepared wires for your breadboard. This was a half-semester project built by a team of four.

My responsibilities were to design and build the main iterations of the feeder, cutter, and the main support board. Although I didn't have much mechanical design experience at the time, I was able to rapidly prototype functional components which were perfected later.

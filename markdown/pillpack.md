As a software development intern at PillPack, I worked on a feature team with
one designer and two other engineers to build in-house software that improved
customer experience. Most of my work revolved around adding new features and
making optimizations to software that currently serves over thousands of users.
Following an Agile system, we iterate over our builds and emphasize on design
before implementation.

My main roles were contributing new features and making existing optimizations
to PillPackâ€™s software stack.

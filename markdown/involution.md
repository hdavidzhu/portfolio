Involution Studios is a software design firm in Arlington, MA. Most of the
firmâ€™s work revolves around healthcare and enterprise software for our clients,
including Partners Health and Microsoft. During the summer of 2015, I worked
with another intern to build an open-source conversational health assistant
called Pearl. [Learn more about Pearl here](https://github.com/openpearl).

My main contributions were software architecture, development and design work
for Pearl - mostly around the front-end application and utilities.

oBay is a marketplace web app inspired by Ebay - built for student use at Olin College. oBay was a 6-week project consisting of 5 people for an experiment dev course called [OlinJS](http://olinjs.github.io/).

The web app is built using MongoDB, Express, Backbone, Node, and Socket.io. We worked with self-enforced Agile and Git-flow practices. The final app is integrated with OlinApps, Venmo, and Imgur APIs.

My primary focus was on front-end Backbone development and back-end integration.

The product can be found at [obay.herokuapp.com](http://obay.herokuapp.com/), and the source code can be found at [github.com/sgrim3/Obay](https://github.com/sgrim3/Obay).

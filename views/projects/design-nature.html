I and four other teammates iterated through several prototypes and designs before constructing our waterproof squid and game. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> The game involves a RC squid controlled by one student and a 'fisherman' controlled by three students. The squid has a magnetic tentacle, and its job is to collect magnetic food items on the bottom of a kiddy swimming pool. Meanwhile, the fisherman is trying to capture the squid. If the fisherman successfully gets the squid, the squid will ink, and the game would be over. Finally, the number of food items the squid collected will be tallied up, and that would be the high score of the game. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> Here's a demonstration: </p> <iframe class="video-center" width="75%" height="75%" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EeI8vXOV7M8?rel=0&modestbranding=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <p dir="ltr"> As young engineering students, we struggled with the early design process as well as creating the right game that supports all of our constraints. One thing that we overestimated was the power output of the servos provided for us. There was not enough drive to propel the squid against the drag of the water. Furthermore, by choosing to construct a water-based toy, we spent a lot of effort trying to keep the internal electronic devices waterproof. As you can see in the demo, the RC receiver accidentally received too much water and lost functionality. </p> <br> <p dir="ltr"> Even with the challenges of waterproofing and volatility of our demo toy, we still managed to pull together as a team to create our squid. This was an important experience for me because I gained better ability to scope engineering projects as well as reading the team atmosphere to determine what the next best move is to make. </p> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YfROxbFPKse1Ug_qWnGNGyaDdvQ7GdnAJv5C2P5SGFI/embed?start=false&loop=true&delayms=15000" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="470" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div>

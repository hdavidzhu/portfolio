This was a half-semester project built by a team of four. <br><br> My responsibilities were to design and build the main iterations of the feeder, cutter, and the main support board. Although I didnâ€™t have much mechanical design experience at the time, I was able to rapidly prototype functional components which were perfected later. <br><br> You can view the whole design process at <a target="_blank" href="http://autoschematic.herokuapp.com/">http://autoschematic.herokuapp.com/</a> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div>

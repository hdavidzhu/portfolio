Due to their need to balance their education and their family responsibilities, the kids in Mumbai may sometimes fall back in work, and this effect quickly builds up until the student canâ€™t handle new school work. <br><br> We created an app that helps the people of the organization provide more tutoring opportunities for these kids. Specifically, we created a Training Needs Analysis app for tutors to report which subjects they would need help in the most. This is because tutors may not feel comfortable teaching some subjects and would like to go through a training program so that their students are getting the best education. <br><br> This way, when the tutors ask for help, the program managers can see which subjects they should train first. Because Save the Children: India is a non-profit, it is much more effective for the program to train tutors based on the highest demand. <br><br> My main contributions for this project consist of designing the database and the backend API for communicating with Mongolabs. This way, everything is synced with the web; all phones running our app would have the same collective information. <br><br> Demo: </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div>
